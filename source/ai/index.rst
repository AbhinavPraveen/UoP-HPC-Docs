Artificial Intelligence (AI)
============================

The Lovelace cluster is capable, particularly with its enterprise grade NVIDIA GPUs, of running demanding AI workloads including training and execution of AI models. Software for this purpose such as Tensorflow, PyTorch and Huggingface Transformers are preinstalled on the cluster and accesible through the modules system (see :doc:`/user-guide/modules`). Some examples of the usage of specific software are given below.
