Projects
========

On the Lovelace cluster, following succesful applications, users are assigned to projects. These represent an intended use case of the cluster, a set of allocated resources and potentially funding. These projects are linked to Project IDs which can be found in Application Approval emails. If you would like a reminder of the Project IDs of the projects you are assosciated to, please contact `hpcsupport@plymouth.ac.uk <mailto:hpcsupport@plymouth.ac.uk>`__.
